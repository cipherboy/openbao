# Contributing

We welcome contributions to OpenBao of any type, whether from users,
programmers, or even those curious about what OpenBao is! For more
general information, see our [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
document in the root of [our repository](https://github.com/openbao/openbao).

:::warning

Disable all generative AI agents while working on OpenBao!

(This includes GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, and others.)

By using generative AI agents, you cannot guarantee that you have the full
legal rights required to submit the code generated by an AI. We require you
use the [DCO ownership](https://developercertificate.org/) sign-off, which
you cannot do with generative AI agents trained on third-party code.

Use of AI in other capacity (search, discussion, &c) remains fine.

Please do not submit such pull-requests to this project. Thanks!
